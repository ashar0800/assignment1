CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment. ,"Yes its price has increased dramatically, but so did the price of tulips in the 1600s.

There is literally no use for this commodity. Invest in stocks or bonds and your investing in future earnings or the ability of a company to pay you back. I’m not a fan of gold as an investment but at least it has some practical use.

The use of crypto as a currency completely defies the definition of currency as it doesn’t hold a stable value.

It’s infuriating that so many people have lost loads of money on “shitcoins” backed by the wealthy and famous. These were obviously pump and dump schemes yet very few are held accountable.

I’m not as well versed on the subject but something to also note is the ridiculous amount of energy demand to “mine” nothing. 

I think there is legitimate use for blockchain technology and the likes but anyone viewing these currencies as investments is a fool.",art_vandelay112,2025-01-04 23:20:55,300,changemyview
TRUMP OFFICIALLY SIGNS CRYPTOCURRENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER,"Trump slammed an executive order down so hard it probably left a crypto-shaped dent in the Resolute Desk. A new “crypto working group” is being formed, and banks are now required to keep serving crypto companies. Central bank digital currencies? Banned outright. The Fed just got benched while Bitcoin keeps cooking.

There’s also a plan to stockpile seized crypto—picture the U.S. government holding onto rugged wallets like some dystopian hedge fund. David Sacks, former PayPal bigwig, has been crowned crypto and AI czar, which feels like the prologue to a meme coin-backed coup.

The Oval Office just turned into the most chaotic crypto exchange on the planet.",ginger-freak,2025-01-23 21:40:51,3081,DeepFuckingValue
"What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now?
","I realize that the best choice depends on my own financial goals and how much risk I'm willing to take. For me, Bitcoin feels like a safe bet because it’s been around for a while and is secure. I also like Ethereum for its smart contracts and the growing DeFi market. Sometimes, I look at newer coins like Cardano or Solana because they might offer big returns. In the end, I believe it's important to research well, keep up with market news and only invest money I can afford to lose. Thanks for the suggestions in advance!",wise_doctor1,2024-07-02 15:51:54,119,CryptoMarkets
The whole cryptocurrency market Will crash,"Im studiyng cryptocurrency, the originale idea was cool. But now its just a speculative asset where only the founders are making real Money promising tò poor people to become Rich. The whole thing Is becoming too big, Much Bitcoin traders sees It like a religion. Countries are putting people Money on cryptocurrencys. People wrongly compare cryptos with Gold, cause they are both speculative assets but gold :
1- is Limitated
2- has other uses than making Money.
3- Is real and you can touch It.
In my opinion cryptos are more like penny-stocks and packets of sub-prime.
I dont know of everyone Is being fooled or i am wrong, but the only way cryptos are not going tò crush Is that they'll become the currency in an hypotetical metaverse or web 3.0. Even if the scenario of us living in a simulation of reality exchanging items wich are not real with Money wich are not real It seems a Little distopic in my opinion. Until this Moment, crypto are only good for buying drugs online. My prevision Is that the whole cryptomarket Will crash nearly before the  Trump's term ends.
Im trying tò figure It out how tò make Money from that, if you know how tell me, if i am wrong on something tell me. 
Thank you for Reading my ideas, Sorry for the broken English.",kappa47bang,2025-01-25 21:23:27,51,Buttcoin
 Cryptocurrency for a beginner.,"Hey all, couple questions for you regarding potentially getting into cryptocurrency…

I for one have very little understanding of it aside from reading a few things on its basic principles. I have heard that with the new Presidential administration coming in it could possibly be good for the crypto world. But who knows. Anyway I am considering making a small investment but I’m not really sure how to go about it.

1. What platform/app would you recommend starting with that’s easy to use/understand? And of course safe.

2. Is now a decent time to buy in? What would be some decent currencies to start with. Bitcoin or ethereum or others?

3. Any general advice would be much appreciated.",Hoopa2020,2024-11-19 14:34:01,20,CryptoMarkets

Trump to eliminate ALL capital gains taxes on Cryptocurrencies issued by U.S. companies.,"President Trump’s administration [reportedly](https://x.com/oroogle/status/1856882307249963333) plans to eliminate capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies issued by U.S.-registered companies. If enacted, this move would exempt American investors from taxes on profits gained from holding certain digital assets.

"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",Layneeeee,2021-02-09 12:03:25,14816,CryptoCurrency

CMV: Cryptocurrency is a net drain on society ,"The whole idea of it being a “currency” is undermined by the lack of ways to spend it.

I keep hearing about crypto rugpulls and pump-and-dumps, and it all feels shady. That’s not even mentioning the environmental costs of mining, which doesn’t even produce anything of value to society and is essentially spending vast resources to perform arbitrary calculations to print money.

I made an infographic of the most popular cryptocurrencies by category,"Hi all, a few weeks ago I made a post listing all the top 50 coins by category.

I have added all that information into an infographic, as well as adding new coins, new categories and making some changes based on your feedback.

I hope you find it useful.

Edit: Due to popular demand I have added Moons (MOON)

**Edit 3: Version 2.0 is below. Thanks for everyone's feedback.**

Changes:

1. Certain coins are easier to see
2. Some categories moved for less confusion, e.g. privacy coins are now under currency along with stablecoins.
3. Icons have been added for ERC20, BEP2/BEP20, and Forks
4. Some descriptions changed slightly for accuracies
5. Some typos fixed (e.g. USDC instead of CSDC)
6. Stellar moved out of the distributed computing category as it doens't offer an on-chain programming language or on-chain smart contracts, it now bridges the currency and finance categories.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit2: Thanks for all the fantastic feedback and awards. I'm working on a version 2 which will address some of the issues people have had.

1. Certain coins hard to find/unclear
2. I didn't intend for privacy coins to look like it was a subset of store of value, however it looks like people are interpreting it that way. I am going to move it under currency and change a few things round so similar categories are grouped together.
3. Thinking of adding icons next to coins indicating additional properties of that coin, e.g. ERC20 token, BSC20 token, Fork of bitcoin
4. Description of DeFi section is off, because some of the projects are centralised, so am changing it to just 'financial services'
5. Various small typos/capital letter inconsistencies.
6. Changing Stellar/XLM to just currency, and possibly make it part of the DeFi group, as the smart contracts are not executed on chain, and so it can't really be considered distributed computing.

A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies 📌,"Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

&#x200B;

**If you have any other suggestions or feel like sharing your experience on passive income and cryptocurrencies, feel free to do that! :)**

Cryptocurrencies would NOT have saved the people of Afghanistan......,"I am a person who fled from Afghanistan in the year 2000......back when the Taliban was in charge as well. It is horrible for me to see them rise to power again today.

My family is still in Kabul. I can tell you that cryptocurrencies would not have saved them. As soon as other countries heard of the Taliban rising, they closed all embassies so nobody could get a visa. It used to be easy to get out of the country to atleast Pakistan, India or China but they too closed their borders when the Taliban march became too 'real'. With no passports, no visums and no money for 90% of the Afghan people, where would they go?

As more and more provinces were being taken, more and more people were forced to go to Kabul. Most of these fugitives had fought against the taliban in their own province and were now forced to sleep in the parks, on the ground and in the parkings lots. The locals of Kabul spared them whatever food they could.......

When the Taliban circled Kabul, hyperinflation occured. Prices of all foods skyrocketed out of fear of dying of starvation. Do you really believe cryptocurrencies could have changed this?

**I think not.**

Also what many people don't realise is that many in Afghanistan are UNBANKED. They only hold some cash and use it to buy stuff. Cash would be more useful in this scenario than having cryptocurrencies on some exchange or even in your wallet. What if they turn off the internet? They will surely censor a large part of the internet if not compeletly turn it off. I remember back in 2000, you weren't even allowed to listen to music, hold a wedding etc. I fear for my family but all I can do is pray.

I hear it echoed on here quite often that x crypto is no good because it's too centralised.  The reality is that most consumers don't really know what that means or why it's good or bad.  Even if they do most people will still happily choose a cheaper product without caring about that too much.

As a moderator for /r/cryptocurrency... What I see is starting to bother me.,"Yes, pardon the strangely titled thread. I believe more in the fundamentals of bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency on the planet.                

The ""meta shift"" I have seen over the past 7 months bothers me. Nobody wants to talk about bitcoin. Nobody wants to discuss mass adoption of bitcoin. Nobody wants to talk about liberating the Lebanese freelance artist or the Iranian just trying to buy games on steam or the village in rural Kenya that is located a 3-hour-walk away from the closest bank. Nobody wants to talk about DLCs and smart contracts on bitcoin or the best non-custodial lightning network wallets. No one is talking about taproot.                

No one is talking about how the creator of bitcoin never sold his coins. People are forgetting the first cryptocurrency that was ever created. People are forgetting metcalfes law.                 

What I find ultimately more disturbing is that during the 2018-2020 bear market more people were talking about / cared to talk about bitcoin than altcoins. It just feels like a hivemind of ""pump my bags"" and little more.               

This is just a slight rant. It's like everyone there delusionally believes that an altcoin will surpass bitcoin and become the standard. If there is going to be another bear market, I welcome it. Just so we can go back to talking about bitcoin and lightning and the technology aspects of it all.                 

EDIT: I strongly feel as though the majority of the new users that we have accumulated since this bull run began are coming from /r/wallstreetbets and /r/dogecoin. The sad part is, these people are throwing out fundamentals like ""market caps"" and just following all the Elon tweets or they got pulled in because they realized that robinhood can shut down stock trading whenever they want but there could be no such level of consensus among all centralized and decentralized exchanges.              

EDIT 2: ""superior technology"" showed up in 2017 in a slew of different flavors and not a single altcoin actually surpassed bitcoin.                

EDIT 3: I see that there is a cross post of this thread to the cc subreddit. To further refine my claims to the belief that no crypto will surpass bitcoin, I responded to a comment someone else here made with the following: All of these questions summarize ""Why bitcoin is the next bitcoin.'"" 

>Which coin is the ""next bitcoin?"" or in other words, the one coin that will replace bitcoin? Why is it that coin and not bitcoin? And how do you convince all of the banks and the traditional financial system to switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why would they switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why not use both? Is there a reason not to use both? This is why there will be no ""next bitcoin"" or a coin that replaces bitcoin.",sgtslaughterTV,2021-05-20 02:57:23,3373,Bitcoin
47.9% of people believe that cryptocurrencies are not a safe investment,"Overall, nearly half (47.9%) of people believe that cryptocurrencies are not a safe investment, and a further 37.1% are unsure about the safety of investing in cryptos.   

Just 13.8% of people regard cryptocurrencies as a safe investment product.

When the data is split by age, it’s clear that it’s mainly young adults who feel that cryptos are a safe investment. Almost a third (27.5%) of those aged between 18 and 34 feel their money is safe when investing in cryptocurrencies, and this figure drops significantly within the older age groups.  

Just 9.7% of adults aged 35 and over view cryptocurrencies as a safe investment, and the figure drops substantially to just 2.9%  when we look at those aged 45 and above.

**People’s attitudes towards the safety of cryptos as an investment, by age**

The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, originated in 2009, making the whole concept of online currency a relatively recent invention. Given that it’s only been around for a decade it’s not surprising that younger people are more at ease with the concept as they have grown up with it. However for older generations there is significantly less trust in something that they still regard as a new development.

&#x200B;

**Cryptocurrencies form a part of wider investment strategies**

As cryptocurrencies become more and more mainstream, many people are starting to include cryptos as part of their wider investment strategies.  

Out of those who have invested in cryptocurrencies, a large percentage (85.7%) also have other investments and savings.

This trend is the same across every age group, however, the percentage of people who only have cryptocurrencies, and no other investments, does increase slightly with age.

&#x200B;

**Percentage of those who do not have any investments other than cryptocurrencies, by age**

**Only half of crypto investors are getting financial advice**

Although cryptocurrencies are volatile and can see people lose their whole investment in a short space of time, only half (56.1%) of investors received professional financial advice before buying cryptos.

But, what’s surprising is that it’s actually the younger age groups who are more likely to take the additional step of getting advice before investing.

Over two thirds (65%) of 18-24 year olds got financial advice before making their investment, and this percentage decreases gradually with age.

"No, Georgia did not pass a bill to teach highschool students about cryptocurrency.","Someone made a thread with [this article](https://invezz.com/news/2021/03/12/georgia-passes-a-bill-to-teach-high-school-students-about-crypto/) and a very clickbaity title to entice and get reactions and comments from all of you (obviously for Moon farming). It got to the frontpage with about 8k upvotes. If you read the article you will see that:

&#x200B;

1. It's from March 12, not recent.
2. Any ""proposed bill"" needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn't ""passed"".
3. It's already dead on the Senate [as you can read here: ""Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, **died in chamber**](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021)""
4. The proposed bill intended to add a **16 point Financial Literacy course** to 10th and 11th graders **where one of them was cryptocurrency** [as you can see here.](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/199139)
5. This is literally in the second paragraph of the original article: *According to the report, the bill aims to amend the current curriculum for 10th and 11th-grade students. The new program would consist of 16 new areas of financial literacy such as cryptocurrency, balancing a checking account, money management, making investments, and completing loan applications, among other traditional subjects.*

&#x200B;

Easy conclusion: Georgia is not teaching students about Crytocurrency. People will upvote whatever makes them feel good even though a simple reading of the article and a small amount of critical thinking would make them at least question the way the headline was written.

* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.
* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.
* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.
* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.
* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.

So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

"All the cryptocurrency tax information you don’t want, but need to know. (US taxes)","**EDIT: Moving this version of a TL:DR to the top. Yes, this is a ton of information and yes, it seems very complicated. I tried to break it down into different transaction types because there are a lot of questions about what is taxed and what isn’t.**

**Generally speaking, you will either incur no tax, income tax, or capital gains tax depending on the transaction type. Also, generally, crypto that you receive as rewards (staking, interest) are taxed as income. Cryptocurrency that you sell will generate capital gains/loss tax.** 

**As of right now, rewards from debit/credit cards are not taxed as income. The IRS views crypto back the same way as it views cash back or airline miles earned  from cards, as a discount on your purchase, not as income.**  

**Anything in this post could become irrelevant if tax code/law changes.**

Which transactions are taxable events and which ones aren’t? What has to be reported and what doesn’t? 

Fair warning: This is going to be a long post with a lot of information. This entire post is a TL:DR of cryptocurrency taxes. 

….but I reluctantly added a TLDR at the end

There are tax laws that absolutely apply, guidance issued by the IRS that isn’t law, and scenarios where no one knows what the hell to do. I’ve tried to sort it out. 


###I’m not a tax expert. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m literally a random Kevin. Use this post as a starting point. Do your own research.

##SECTION 1: Excerpts from the ***IRS*** description of cryptocurrency as stated on IRS. GOV

“Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain.”\
“Virtual currency is a digital representation of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency (“real currency”), that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange.”\
“Regardless of the label applied, if a particular asset has the characteristics of virtual currency, it will be treated as virtual currency for Federal income tax purposes.”\
“Virtual currency is treated as property and general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.”

##SECTION 2: Types of taxes associated with crypto and their rates

###2A Income Tax

Your ***tax liability*** for certain cryptocurrency transactions (listed and explained in section 3) will be based on one of the seven tax rates that apply to you based on your ***adjusted*** ***gross*** ***income*** and filing status. 

The proceeds you receive from qualifying transactions will be taxed according to your personal income bracket along with the rest of your income. This is a different tax than the tax that’s levied on the sale of ***capital*** ***assets***. 

The 2021 income tax brackets:

| RATE | SINGLE | MARRIED/JOINT |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 10% | $0-$9,950 | $0-$19,000 |
| 12% | $9,951-$40,525 | $19,901-$81,050 |
| 22% | $40,526-$86,375 | $81,051-$172,750 | 
| 24% | $86,376-$164,925 | $172,751-$329,850 |
| 32% | $164,296-$209,425 | $329,851-$418,850 |
| 35% | $209,426-$523,600 | $418,851-$628,300 |
| 37% | $523,601 + | $628,301 + |

| RATE | MARRIED/SEPARATE | HEAD OF HOUSE |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 10% | $0-$9,950 | $0-$14,200 |
| 12% | $9,951-$40,525 | $14,201-$54,200 |
| 22% | $40,526-$86,376 | $54,201-$86,350 |
| 24% | $86,376-$164,925 | $86,351-$164,900 |
| 32% | $164,926-$209,425 | $164,901-$209,400 |
| 35% | $209,426-$314,150 | $209,401-$523,600 |
| 37% | $314,151 + | $523,601 + |

###2B Capital Gains: Short Term

Short term capital gains tax is applied to the ***realized*** ***gains*** from the selling, trading, or ***disposal*** of cryptocurrency that you’ve held for less than one year. 

The tax rate is the same as the rate you’d pay for ordinary income, based on your personal tax bracket, the same brackets listed above in section 2A. 


###2C Capital Gains: Long Term

Long term capital gains tax is applied to crypto that you hold for more than one year before selling or trading. These rates are typically much lower than ordinary income. 2021 long term capital gains brackets: 

| RATE | SINGLE | MARRIED FILING SEPARATE |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 0% | $0-$40,000 | $0-$40,000 |
| 15% | $40,401-$445,850 | $40,401-$445,850 |
| 20% | $445,000 + | $445,000 |

| RATE | MARRIED FILING JOINT | HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 0% | $0-$80,000 | $0-$54,100 |
| 15% | $80,801-$501,600 | $54,101-$473,750 |
| 20% | $501,600 + | $473,751 + |

___

###2C Collectible Capital Gains

The IRS has not issued a definitive guidance on how certain cryptocurrency may be taxed in this way but a growing opinion is that some tokens will fall under the IRS definition of ***collectible*** ***capital*** ***assets***. This tax has a flat rate of 28% We’ll cover these tokens in the next section. Can you guess what’s in question?

The IRS defines collectible assets broadly. Any work of art, most metals, gems, coins and this super general statement: Any personal property that the IRS determines a collectible under ***IRC*** ***Section*** ***408(m)***. 

**It is important to point out that each block of income is taxed at the rate it corresponds to and capital gains do to push your ordinary income into higher tax bracket. I’ll repeat this again later because it can be quite confusing.**

___


##SECTION 3 Taxable events, corresponding tax rates, non taxable events, and required reporting

The part you’ve been waiting for! Which cryptocurrency transactions trigger a ***taxable*** ***event*** ? How are they taxed? Let’s explore. 

Examples in **Section 4** for different scenarios. 

###3A 3B 3C Purchasing, Holding and Transferring. 

These are not taxable events. No tax liability of any kind is incurred by these actions alone and you don’t have to report crypto that you buy and transfer if you don’t sell or trade it. Even if the value of your crypto rises or falls dramatically, you own no taxes because you have not realized gains. 

**NOTE:** Having a Record of every transaction you make, regardless of tax liability or the current reporting requirement, is very important. 

To be able to properly report when you *do* trigger a taxable event you’ll need to know either your ***cost*** ***basis*** or the ***fair*** ***market*** ***value*** (one of these apply depending on how you acquired it and what you do with it) for each transaction, the amount of fiat spent, the amount of crypto purchased, the date of purchase and any fees you paid.

It’s also important to note that your cost basis is different than your ***average*** ***cost***. 

###3D Crypt rewards cards: general

Generally, the IRS categorizes credit and debit card rewards as non-taxable. They are treated as rebates or discounts on what you purchased. 

That implies that for now, all those juicy crypto back rewards we get do not trigger any taxable event and no reporting requirements upon receipt (Capital gains, income, or otherwise). 

Selling them will trigger a taxable event though, so you’ll need to know the fair market value at the time you received the rewards and the amount received for each transaction. 
Sounds like a hassle? There are multiple ways to record transactions, I do it manually through Blockfolio (now FTX) but there’s software that can track *almost* everything. 

**NOTE** If you receive cryptocurrency through rewards, staking, interest or any means other than purchasing (using fiat or crypto) the fair market value (market price) at the time you received them becomes your cost basis for tax purposes. 

Some platforms may send you a ***1099-MISC*** if you go over a certain amount of rewards, but that doesn’t make it taxable. Whether something is listed on a 1099-MISC and whether it’s taxable are two different questions. 

  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Fiat Payments

Crypto rewards Cards that are pre-loaded with fiat, or that utilize fiat as the means of payment, do not trigger a taxable event when you make a purchase using the card and receive crypto back because you are paying with the US Dollar, the ***legal*** ***tender*** of The United States. 
   

  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Crypto Payments

Cards that spend your crypto, whether they are rewards cards or not, trigger a taxable event. (stable coins are no exception, but do not incur tax liabilities in *most* cases) When using a card to spend crypto, the card issuing platform is liquidating your crypto to fiat then using the fiat for the purchase via the card, this is a disposal of a capital asset. 

Even if the provider of the goods/service you purchase from accepts crypto, and you actually transfer your crypto to them via a card or any other method, you are triggering a taxable event by trading crypto for goods and services. 


  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Stable coin payments 

Crypto Card issuing platforms that guarantee a 1:1 ratio between US Dollars and the stable coin the card utilizes, will not result in capital gains or losses, but, once again this is the disposal of a capital asset so each transaction is still required to be reported. 

Stable coins are still cryptocurrency and this means that transactions involving stable coins are disposal of capital assets. Although minimal, stable coin prices can fluctuate. If you’re not guaranteed a 1:1 ratio, you may trigger a taxable event and you’ll need to calculate your profit or loss. 

While using your crypto to pay for goods and services via a pre-loaded card triggers a taxable event, it doesn’t always result in a capital gain. If the fair market value at the time of your payment to a merchant is lower than your cost basis, you may actually incur a ***capital*** ***loss*** that can be used to offset gains. (With some exceptions)

###3E 3F 3G Staking Rewards, Earning interest, (including Defi) and Airdrops

Each one of these transactions trigger a taxable event. They are viewed by the IRS in the same way as fiat interest in traditional finance. They are required to be reported and are taxed as income at your personal tax rate, not as capital gains… unless or until you sell. 

What separates these payments from traditional fiat interest is in crypto, for each individual transaction, you need to know the fair market value on the date you received the crypto because upon selling these rewards, the fair market value becomes the cost basis that you must use to calculate your profit/loss and the resulting capital gain or capital loss. 


###3H 3I Selling crypto for fiat and crypto to crypto trades/transactions

These are both taxable events and both result in capital gains/loss tax. Selling crypto, your property as defined by the IRS, is of course a taxable event and profit is taxed the same as stocks, gold, or any other “property”. Capital gains apply, either short or long term and according to the bracket you’re in. 

Trading one crypto to another crypto is taxed exactly the same way. You’re  disposing of one asset and purchasing another that are both valued in US dollars. 

###3J Cryptocurrency mining and (staking revisited)

Tax calculations based on the receiving of cryptocurrency through mining are taxed similarly to staking and there’s a lot of debate about this, especially staking rewards. 

According to the IRS, when a taxpayer successfully mines Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency he/she must include it in their gross income after determining the fair market value at the time they receive it. 

There are two ways to report mining rewards on your taxes: as a  ***hobby*** or as a ***business*** as defined by the IRS. In both, much like interest, Airdrops, and staking rewards, the fair market value (at the time you received them) of your mining rewards will be considered income and taxed at your personal tax bracket. 

As a hobby, this will be reported on ***form*** ***1040*** as “other income”. If you run a mining operation as a business, you can fully deduct expenses and the net profit is taxable and reported on ***Schedule*** ***C***. 

###3K Crypto received as payments for goods and services, crypto received as wages and salary and using crypto to pay employees

   - ###Crypto received as payment for goods and services 

Similar to mining, payments received in Cryptocurrency must be converted to their value in US dollars and included as income. Expenses can be deducted if you are a business owner. 

  - ###Crypto received as a form of wage or salary payment, for employees and employers. 

Employers must convert  employee earnings paid in crypto to US dollars on the employees W-2 form. These wages are subject to the same withholdings as payment in US dollars. Employers also incur capital gains tax for disposing of their crypto as payment to employees. 

And again, the fair market value at the time you receive the crypto becomes your cost basis if you trade. 

###3L NFTs

Creating an NFT is not a taxable event, and has no value to report when you create it, (if you paid a network or Gas fee with crypto to mint the NFT, that is a disposal and Capital gains apply as if you sold or traded) however, it is considered a cryptocurrency by the IRS. Trading an NFT for another NFT, disposing of an NFT for a fungible cryptocurrency or US dollars is a taxable event subject to capital gains/losses. 

Many NFTs are considered collectibles and may fall under the IRS definition of a ***collectible*** ***capital*** ***asset***. The IRS has not issued guidance on this so the presumption right now is to use the definition of a standard capital asset. 

Trading cards, for example, are not specifically listed by the IRS as collectible capital assets but have historically been taxed as such and this brings to mind NFTs like the NBA Top Shots series. 

The short term rule applies to collectibles in the same way as regular capital gains tax, it’s based on your income tax bracket. However, Long term collectible capital gains tax is a flat 28%. That’s strange to me. 

**I want to reiterate that currently the IRS has not stated that any cryptocurrency is to be taxed as a  collectible capital asset tax. It is not out of the realm of possibility for them to do so and it’s something to keep in mind.**

There are NFTs that do not fit the definition of a collectible. Take Uniswap V3 as an example. Liquidity positions are not represented by ERC-20 tokens anymore, they are represented by NFTs and are obviously different than NFTs that represent art of any kind.

##SECTION 4 Determining your profit/loss from different transactions and your tax liability with examples of transactions from section 3

You’re going to basically need a record of every transaction that involves cryptocurrency. You can do it manually with a notes app, excel spreadsheet or a crypto tax software tool that pulls the information from all your exchanges and wallets. Some of these software programs don’t cover everything though. You’ll get reports from many exchanges and you can find a record of your transactions on these exchanges. 

####INFO YOU’ll NEED
  - cost basis or fair market value
  - how you acquired the crypto (income or purchase)
  - how much crypto you acquired or sold 
  - how much fiat you invested or how much fiat received for the sell
  - the date you acquired or sold the crypto 


###EXAMPLE 1 Determining capital gain and taxes owed on crypto you bought, held, transferred then later sold. 

**NOTE**: Remember to include fees. Fees increase your costs basis which serves to lower your Capital gains, assuming you buy low sell high. 

  - Frank buys 10 ETH  on December 10, 2020. 1 ETH was $1000 and he paid a 0.5% fee - He spent $10,050
  - The transaction fee was 0.5%, or $50
  - $10,000 invested + $50 in fees = $10,050 / 10 ETH = **$1005** cost basis per ETH
 - Frank transfers the 10 ETH to a ledger where he plans to hold it for one year. 

 **NOTE** No fee =  Cost basis is the exact price per coin. Fee = include the fee, $50 in this case, to your total investment, divide total investment by total coins purchased. (If you incur other fees for transfers, those can be included as well.) Cost basis is now $1005 for tax purposes. 

If you incur fees when you sale, deduct those fees from your total proceeds. 

  - On December 11, 2021 (over 1 year later) Frank transfers back to an exchange and sells 5 of his 10 ETH when Ethereum his $10,000. He pays $250 in fees. Remember that he paid $1005 per ETH when he made his purchase. 

  - 5 ETH X $10,000 per ETH = $50,000 - $250 fee = **$49,750** net proceeds 
  - The next step is to deduct your cost basis from your proceeds from the sale. 
  - **$1005** cost basis X 5 ETH = **$5025** total cost basis
   - Net proceeds $49,750 - $5025 cost basis is **$44,725** long term capital gain. 
   - Frank is married and they file jointly, she has a boyfriend but that doesn’t affect taxes. Their ordinary taxable income (not including the crypto proceeds) is $90,000 which puts them in the 15% long term capital gains bracket. 

**NOTE** capital gains cannot push your ordinary income into a higher tax bracket. 

   - $44,725 capital gain X 0.15 (taxed at 15%) capital gain tax rate = **$6,708.75** owed in capital gains tax

### EXAMPLE 2 Expanding on the above scenario to illustrate the FIFO (first in first out) method of tax reporting. 
 

  - Frank also purchased 2 more ETH in March 2021 (we’ll assume no fees this time for simplicity). Ethereum was $2,500. His cost basis for these 2 ETH is $2,500 each. 
  - We know from the first example that Frank sold 5 ETH from the original 10 he purchased. He now has 7 ETH. 5 left with a cost basis of **$1005** and 2 with a cost basis of **$2,500**
  - On January 1, 2022 Ethereum drops to $2000 and He sells 6 ETH
  - 6 ETH X $2000 = **$12,000** net proceeds 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Since Frank has two different cost basis for Ethereum and his sale was for more ETH than he owns at the first cost basis of $1005, the sell needs to be split into two transactions when figuring taxes. 

FULL TRANSACTION
6 ETH sold at $2,000 ETH = $12,000 


TAX TRANSACTION ONE
  - He has 5 ETH from 2020 with a cost basis of $1005 per ETH They were purchased first, they sell first. FIFO
   - 5 ETH @ $1005 cost basis = $5025 cost basis, sold for $2000 per ETH or $10,000 total proceeds 
   - $10,000 proceeds  - $5025 cost basis  = **$4,975 LONG TERM NET GAIN on these 5 ETH**

TAX TRANSACTION TWO
   - He has 2 ETH that he purchased for $2,500 and sold one of them (he sold 6 total, the 5 left from his original purchase plus 1 from his latest purchase = 6)
 - All 10 of the original ETH he bought have been sold. He must now use 1 of the 2 he recently purchased to determine his tax liability on this 6 ETH sale. 
   - 1 ETH @ $2,500 cost basis sold for $2,000 total
   - $2,000 proceeds - $2,500 cost basis  = **$500 SHORT TERM NET LOSS**

  - Frank has two taxable situations here that resulted from one sale. A **$4,975 long term capital gain** that he owes 15% tax on ($746.25) and a **$500 Capital loss** that he can claim. 

**NOTE** Capital losses are first used to offset gains of the same type. So, short term losses are first deducted from short term gains and long term against long term. Losses of either type that are higher than gains of the same type can then be used to deduct against the other kind of gain. 

###If you have an overall net capital loss for a tax year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against your income. Any capital loss in excess of $3,000 can be carried over to subsequent years and deducted against capital gains first then other kinds of income. Married filing separate is $1,500 for these scenarios. 

###EXAMPLE 3 crypto received as staking or interest payments. Claiming them as income. 

Karen has  10,000 ADA that she wants to stake. She staked and received rewards in February. 

| REWARD/DATE | ADA FMV | REWARD VALUE | 
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 6.124 FEB 5 | $0.44 | $2.69 |
| 6.654 FEB 10 | $0.93 | $4.26 |
| 5.976 FEB 15 | $0.86 | $3.53 |
| 6.612 FEB 20 | $1.12 | $7.41 |
| 6.489 FEB 25 | $1.08 | $7.01 |

  *FMV in the table is Fair Market Value, the price 1 ADA was trading for at the time rewards were received. 
- Karen earned 31.855 ADA 
  - Each of these rewards has a different fair market value( $.44 $.93 $.86 $1.12 $1.08 per ADA) and, as shown, represent income of $2.69 + $4.26 + $3.53 + $7.41 + $7.01 each for a total of **$24.90 of income**.     
  - This $24.90 will simply be added together with the rest of Karen’s taxable income. 
 - Karen is single and has an adjustment gross income of $35,020 which includes the staking income. 
 - $35,020 puts her in the 12% bracket, with the first $9,950 is taxed at the 10% rate. 
 - Karen’s owes 10% on the first $9,950 = $995
 - The remaining $25,070 is taxed at 12% = $3008.40

###EXAMPLE 4 Expanding on staking rewards. Selling them and using FIFO

We know that our staking and interest rewards are considered income and taxed according to our personal tax bracket. This changes when you sell your staking reward. You’ll owe capital gains tax. 

In a different scenario, instead of just holding the rewards and claiming them as income, she sold the rewards. 

**NOTE** **If you sell the rewards in the same calendar year that you receive them then you will not claim them as income and claim capital gains, only capital gains. You will use the fair market value to determine your cost basis (same info in the previous table) and short term capital gain.** 

Let’s say Karen sold those first 10,000 and just has the staking rewards left to illustrate. 

 - Karen decides to sell the rest of her ADA and all she has left are staking rewards. 
 - Karen received these ADA as rewards so she’ll have to know the fair market value at the time she received them. 

*same table from above

| REWARD/DATE | ADA FMV | REWARD VALUE | 
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 6.124 FEB 5 | $0.44 | $2.69 |
| 6.654 FEB 10 | $0.93 | $4.26 |
| 5.976 FEB 15 | $0.86 | $3.53 |

 - She sells 18 ADA at $3.00. Assuming these were next on the list to be sold using FIFO, she uses ADA from her first 3 rewards dates. 
 - This is one sell but remember that we have several different cost basis so we’ll have to break it down. 
 - First out of her 18 total sell is the 6.124 ADA she received on February 5th, ADA was trading at $0.44 that day, $0.44 is the fair market value and now becomes her Cost basis.  
 - 6.124 ADA X $0.44 Cost basis = $2.69 total cost
 - 6.124 ADA X $3.00 ADA sell price = $18.37 total proceeds
 - $18.37 total proceeds - $2.69 total cost = **$15.68 short term capital gain**
 - The second part of the 18 ADA transaction will use the 6.654 ADA she received on February 10th with a fair market value, now her cost basis, of $0.93
 - 6.654 ADA X $0.93 cost basis = $5.72 total cost. 
 - 6.654 ADA X $3.00 ADA sell price = $19.96 proceeds 
 - $19.96 proceeds - $5.72 = **$14.24 short term capital gain.** 
 - The third part of the transaction will use 5.222 (6.124 + 6.654 + 5.222 = 18) out of the 5.976 ADA she received on February 15th with a cost basis of $0.86
 - 5.222 ADA X $0.86 cost basis = $4.49 total cost
 - 5.222 ADA X $3.00 ADA sale price = $15.67 proceeds 
 - $15.67 proceeds - $4.49 total cost = **$11.18 short term Capital gains.** 
 - Now we add each part of the transaction. 
 - $15.68 + $14.24 + $11.18 = **$41.11 total short term capital gains** from the sale of 18 ADA received as staking rewards. 
 - Karen is married in this scenario and they had a combined income of $90,000 which puts the top end of their income and the short term gains in the 24% tax bracket. 
 - Karen and Kevin will owe $9.87 in short term Capital gains tax on the sale of the 18 ADA at $3.00

###EXAMPLE 5 Crypto to Crypto trades

  - Kevin wants to buy TRAC but can only find it with a BTC pair. 
   - He buys $250 worth of Bitcoin at $50,000
  - $250 investment / $50,000 BITCOIN = .005 BTC purchased
  - He trades his .005 BTC for 650 TRAC at $0.40 - Bitcoin had risen to $52,000 at the time of his TRAC trade. 
  - When you trade crypto to crypto, you’re essentially selling one crypto to fiat and buying another crypto. The IRS views this as a disposal of one capital asset and the purchase of another. 
   - .005 BTC X 52K = $260 / $.40 TRAC = 650 TRAC
  - His cost basis for BTC was $50,000 ($250) and when he disposed of it for TRAC the price had risen to $52,000 ($260)
  - $260 proceeds - $250 cost = $10 short term capital gain. 
  - Kevin incurred a capital gain on his BTC to TRAC trade. 

###Ways to minimize taxes owed. 

  - Monitor your holding period. Try to turn short term gains into long term gains. 
  - Use losses to offset gains and wash sales are currently allowed but be careful because the IRS has a clause called ***The Economic Substance Doctrine***
  - Keep records of all of the fees that you pay for everything
  - Donate to charity
  - Gift crypto to family members 
  - Consider a crypto self directed retirement account 
  - If you mine, deduct every expense possible. 
  - Use every deduction or credit available to lower your taxable income

This post was born from my research into tax law and code due to my disagreements with the way newly mined or minted coins are taxed.

___

TLDR: If you purchase crypto, you pay capital gains/loss when you sell. If it’s a reward (except from crypto back cards) from interest, staking or mining, you owe income tax on it and if you sell it then you owe capital gains tax. 

Any crypto you trade/sell/dispose of is subject to Capital gains tax.

___ 



###Edit: There is software that can compile most of your trading, staking, etc for you. Koinly, CrytoTrader,Tax and CoinTracker are highly recommended.

###Edit: You don’t have to use FIFO, that’s just a common method and most preferred. It’s easier to keep up with in my opinion but that’s your choice.

###Edit: It’s important to note that long term Capital gains will not push your ordinary income into a higher tax bracket. Your ordinary income is taxed first.",Kevin3683,2021-09-12 00:10:43,2726,CryptoCurrency
"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

"A lot of people are hoping Cryptocurrency will ""kill"" banks. Banks are never going away. What you should be hoping for is Cryptocurrency to change how banks operate.","Yes, it's the cypherpunk dream - To be part of a financial revolution that topples the current financial system, leading to the overthrow of your overlords, and the rise of an entirely decentralized financial system.

Unfortunately like some dreams, that needs a dose of cold water - It's never going to happen. 

Banks in some form have been around since the earliest merchants in history. They evolved into the religious ruling class and eventually into the privately owned and government subsidized businesses you see today.

And they're doing awesome. Every year is a record profit, paid for by **your money**.

- https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-nova-scotia-beats-profit-estimates-third-quarter-2021-08-24/ 

Banks in Canada are kicking ass. After all, why wouldn't they? They have all the funds in the world (Yours) to play with. Everyone who isn't a crypto nerd like us has money in a bank somewhere, and it is earning banks mindboggling record blowing profits quarter after quarter. Monopolies on people's money is great - If you're a bank.

So, this is where Crypto comes in. Giving people an alternative revenue stream, a choice. Somewhere else to put your money, and if you're smart and savvy, a way to *permanently manage your money by yourself*.

Banks *hate* this. Why wouldn't they? It directly impacts their business, influences their massive monopoly, and hurts their profit margins.

The real power of Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance is *not to tear down the traditional banking structure*.

It is to **force banks and traditional financial systems to adapt and become competitive with a changing market**.

Every time you see a bank, credit union, or big name that previously ""hated"" Bitcoin offering it to their clients, know that you're a part of that change. When wire transfer amounts go down, you're part of that change. When you notice banks changing their fee structures, or interest rates, you're part of that change. 

You're helping banks move out of the dark ages, breaking down a monopoly, and gaining not only financial freedom, but financial wisdom too, which is way more important.

Don't worry about the banks. They're going to be there, doing their thing. There are always going to be people who need a bank, whether it is trust, reliance, or just fear of things going wrong. That's fine.

Every time you take money out of your bank to invest in crypto, you're making people in the financial system think - *""Why isn't this money staying with us, and what can we do to keep it?""* No matter what, this benefits us all.

A competitive and evolving financial system benefits us all.  Don't worry about the banks, build your own future. They'll follow suit.",LargeSnorlax,2021-08-25 15:28:50,3187,CryptoCurrency
Tips for Young/New Crypto Investors from a Real Grandma into Cryptocurrency...,"Yep, I get it. Boomers aren't cool.  We are old, seemingly grumpy, not risk takers, and old school. But please, give me a minute to make you think. We were once college students or just young folks struggling to make it just like you.   

Here are some thoughts:   

1. Keep your day job. (Or get a day job!) Mine fiat by hard work every day to invest in cryptocurrency if that's your goal. Work hard and efficiently.   

You'll be happier working - I don't care how many people want to stay home and do nothing. You'll get bored. Or depressed. Or start drinking. I promise, it's not all roses having no purpose in life. 
As u/antonito901 wrote in a good article on this sub, Crypto = Great. Crypto + a Job = Wonderful!   

2. Even if you get your moon, stay in school or build your dream.  Start a business, do what you love - not what you're told to love;  go to trade school or college, even the school of hard knocks. Just get educated, wherever, however, you can. Money is not the goal...a better life is.   

3. Your 20's, 30's and 40s may take you far from family and loved ones, but work hard to keep connected with them as they will become even more important to you with each passing decade. (Not crypto advice but living advice!)   

4. Investing is risky. Don't invest what you don't have. Pay off debt (I learned this the hard way) and your life will be so much more worry free and happier. Buy necessities such as a simple car or house before that Lambo. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Don't dabble in meme coins unless you have lots of extra money you can afford to throw around.   

5.  Getting Rich Quick is usually a scam. If it were easy,  why doesn't everyone do it? Stay away from poo coins. Don't get angry when older people suggest that meme coins have no long term value. Most or all will not. Even Doge's time will come, it will grow old and out of people's minds unless it quickly develops more use cases.  Stay off CryptoMoonShots.   

Finally, failure is okay, even in Crypto. Each investment will teach you a lesson. Each time you sell will give you information. You twenty and thirty somethings have a LIFE CHANGING opportunity with cryptocurrencies. Remember it might take time,  don't sell on a whim or a worry.   

Good luck, I hope you each reach your moons, no matter what it is!",Content_Structure118,2021-05-18 23:47:33,3610,CryptoCurrency

"If all cryptocurrency fell to 0$ tomorrow, how fucked are you ?","Hello fellow crypto enjoyers.

We all know the rules of crypto investments. One of those rules, for the new people around here, is « You shall only invest what you are not afraid to loose ».

But realistically, we all know there’s a lot of people that invest a lot more than what they can afford to loose. 

Personally, I’m a pretty broke student, and 70% of my capital is in crypto. If I happened to loose that, I would be basically homeless pretty soon !

So, if all crypto fell to 0$ or something close to that, how deep in the mud are you ? This can also serve as a reminder to be careful about the projects you invest in.",Minelucious,2022-01-04 18:16:47,1644,CryptoCurrency

There are now 2 Dog coins on the top 10 Cryptocurrencies...,"It's kinda funny how we all keep bashing said meme coins, and they just don't care, I think it's time to accept that logics don't apply anymore, 2 of the top 10 crypto are dog coins, there are actual people getting rich from memes, how crazy is that?  

Some of you might feel let down abut this, I know I did, mostly because there are other projects I believe in that aren't doing nearly as good (SHIB over DOT, the f is wrong with you people 🙁 ) but take your time to think it first before FOMOing, this may be a hype run and there will be a lot fear involved!

The incoming hyper inflation will create an extremely bullish cryptocurrency market - Kotaki Fund leaks,"*""The incoming hyper inflation will create an extremely bullish cryptocurrency market which will attract more and more investors to join.""* 

**source**: inferkit website

**A report from Kotaki Fund (the biggest Japanese HF) indicates that cryptocurrencies will rise to an unprecedented level of maturity during late 2022.** 

A leaked internal memo from Kotaki Fund mentioned that the Presidency of Lanayru has drafted a plan for cryptocurrency adoption and that they are in contact with countries that have already being using cryptocurrencies.  

It is also implied that an International Monetary Fund equivalent  with cryptocurrency backings is in the works since early 2020 and that stock and crypto market already have a symbiotic relationship. Their funds have been spent for evaluating the situation in cryptocurrency and creating social-economic alliances.

This is a very positive sign to investors, the probability of Bitcoin to overtake more traditional currencies is very high in more and more countries.  The leaks also imply that last year's exits from traditional stock market investments (several executives have closed their positions) has something to do with ICF (International Cryptocurrency Fund).

&#x200B;

I've forgot several things + the ""promises"" of launch of these products, anywhere from Q1-Q3 of this year, and not a single one was launched properly.

The coins they had $DMScript (DMST), $Avaluse (AVAL) and $[10x.gg](https://10x.gg) (XGG) rebranded Racoons later on have $0 valuation due to the liquidity being removed and the initial DMScript coin being ""hacked"" on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20 token) which they later just decided to swap to another network (Binance Smart Chain) and created a BEP-20 token: [https://dmscript.medium.com/the-new-token-55df83776f30](https://dmscript.medium.com/the-new-token-55df83776f30)

&#x200B;

Noone from M1 Eden, OG or Team Secret is responding to me, so I guess let's just post this here..

According to Coingecko the highest price for $DMScript was at $0.342785 ([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dmscript](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dmscript)), and the amount of coins available being 100m the market cap would be at $34m at the peak.

ERC-20 contract - [https://etherscan.io/token/0xF29992D7b589A0A6bD2de7Be29a97A6EB73EaF85](https://etherscan.io/token/0xF29992D7b589A0A6bD2de7Be29a97A6EB73EaF85)

The team pulled an exit-scam and are hiding their faces (linkedin, removing tweets and adjusting the website to hide their identities). But OG, Team Secret and M1 Eden are just enjoying their money and moving on without taking any responsibilities. I would have never invested in this shitcoin if it wasn't for the big names of these esport teams.

Apologies for the poor grammar and there's plenty of more evidence and shilling that I haven't included.  


edit: to clarify, yes it's kind of a gamble to invest in a company this early. But I'm not putting money in a slot machine here, I'm investing in the company, similar to how you buy $AMZN because you believe the company will increase in value because of their services or products.

"Cryptocurrencies will not kill banks, but cryptocurrencies provide an alternative to people which will force banks to improve conditions for their customers","Like it or not, the banks are here and they are not going anywhere. They will always be here, doing their job which is fine.

As much as cryptocurrencies have an impact on people, and therefore on banks, it is the governments that will not allow banks to fail.

There will always be people who will use the banks.

But due to the influence and growth of cryptocurrencies, banks will have to change their way of business.

They will have to improve the conditions for their clients, because people now have an alternative, and that alternative sounds good. There are already people who have most of their money in cryptocurrencies, but all of them leave some in the bank or in fiat in case something with crypto goes wrong.

Banks have been deeply ingrained in our society and our system for a long time. 

It takes time to crypto do the same but it will happen.

If banks are going to go to war with cryptocurrencies, let them go. We know very well that nothing can happen to them, and competitive and evolving financial system benefits us all.

What is your #1 cryptocurrency market rule that you will never break?,"As we see many newcomers enter the market, they don't have a sense for the market like those who have had long term experience. 

A lot of easy to avoid mistakes are made. People lose a ton of money. 

Those who have weathered the 2018 crash have some tough skin and rigid rules they will never break in the crypto market. Tons of this insight comes from past mistakes we have all made. 

A rule I've learned not to break is to never sell 100% of a crypto to buy a new one. Always save around 10% or more. If I had done this with ETH over the last 5 years my ETH bag would be substantial.

Is that true in practice? I wouldn’t say, and before the coins had over $2 billion in market capital so they did good they are doing good but...

Their prices have dropped and market capital went down. People who invested in ATH waiting for that ""forget and earn"" burned themselves. Not saying that the projects are dead, but for someone who invested in ATH they could look dead.

> The S&P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&P’s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.

> “With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world’s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.

> Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.

> Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.

So, what are the implications for bitcoin and the nascent cryptocurrency industry?",Happy_Pizza_,2020-12-03 14:28:39,1974,investing
“Cryptocurrency investing has a big gender problem.” What the hell,"This is as cringe try hard feminism as it gets. 

To quote CNBC:
>Women are lagging behind men in their rates of cryptocurrency investing, just as they have historically struggled to keep pace with men in more traditional investment verticals.

Who exactly is trying to keep women out of crypto? Literally no one. On the contrary, with crypto ANYONE can invest. Men, women, trans, cats, dogs who gives a shit?

And the next bomb they drol in the article 

> Black women face the highest investing barriers.

…who is preventing them? Crypto is for everyone. It was designed to be such. 

I am the biggeat supporter for women and all gendrea to get in crypto but this article just grinds my gears.

Missing the old r/Cryptocurrency,"I don't want to burst anyone's bubble but lately its all been posts about how cryptocurrency has helped someone or how someone is suffering in their country and moons helped them out. Where are the good old days when we used to talk about news related to cryptocurrencies rather than personal benefits? I don't mean to be rude but the purpose of this subreddit was to educate people about what's going on in the crypto world, I mean, it even says so in the community description.

*The official source for CryptoCurrency News, Discussion & Analysis.*

But lately, it has been none of that and doesn't quite provide any useful information regarding crypto but instead we have posts about how it helped someone from a third world country undergo a penis enlargement surgery after selling all the moons they made.

Edit: I know that we're all in this together and we should help each other out. But someone who asks for moons because it'll help their financial situation is not more deserving of it than someone who brings in useful information to this subreddit. I believe that if we reward people who provide useful and relevant info, it'll also motivate people to do more thorough research and make better contributions to this society.",praj18,2021-04-19 08:36:55,1712,CryptoCurrency

"Humanity needs a cryptocurrency that is ""mined"" by doing good deeds.","Obviously I've no idea how that would work. It's a thought experiment more than anything, but it's exactly what is needed. 

The more valuable it becomes, the more incentive there is to do good. In times of national or international strife, the value would supposedly rise, to encourage more positive actions. 

At some point it might even be useful to consider making this the basis store of value, since ""scarcity"" like gold is kinda silly, and ""arbitrary"" value like btc that is able to be manipulated by financial interest alone means that the rich continue to benefit more significantly than ""normal"" people. 

It would have to be one-directional tradable though, or something. Or only able to be purchased (or burned) by institutions delivering programs. 

Or awarded by consensus of others, with the scarcity of your awarding determining the strength of your vote to award. (To prevent people forming a group and just awarding each other back and forth). 

And penalties could be leveraged against institutions or govts that commit bad actions, like polluting a river, tearing down a forest, or, say, displacing an entire population from their residences. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

In fact the system could be entirely sentimental, where people contribute and vote for activities they see as good or bad. 

This is just brainstorm, no idea how any of it would work obviously. The idea though fundamentally would be to provide a counter to raw profiteering - some kind of social accountability for both good and bad. 

And now I realise this sounds exactly like ""social credit"" so obviously it would have to be designed to address the flaws in those systems heh.",footofwrath,2025-02-07 08:38:18,103,CryptoCurrency

We need to talk more about actually using cryptocurrency and not only “investing” on it,"It is almost like cryptocurrencies became stocks, but they are more than that. Not only do they grow in value but can be used as a easier form of payment (among other things). You probably heard about they guy that bough pizza with bitcoin being an idiot, but he was using crypto to pay for something like it was design to do. I completely understand the investment side of cryptocurrencies and that is great but perhaps using it would bring more adoption and in the end increase value.

Congress got a crash course on cryptocurrency.,"I'm not going to dive deep into all the details but I watched and heard most of today's hearing and thought it went fairly well except for one or two old dinosaur clowns who wanted to be funny and just brought negativity.

The short is this.

* Gary Gensler took a beating. The witnesses and some members of the committee over emphasized the need for less interpretation but instead more guidance being needed to be provided by the SEC.
* To no ones surprise Replublicans argued that regulation would move this tech away from America. Democrats argued defending and protecting consumers. (please spare us all your personal feeling toward party) we just don't care.
* The lady who called the hearing is concerned how fast the industry is growing and is bothered by celebrities endorsing crypto. I agree with her on the 2nd part. We don't need these clowns on tik tok or you tube telling people to invest on etheruem max for their one shot to the moon. BTW whatever happened to that shit coin?
* The big topic was stable coins and we knew this. There was also talk of a CBDC but stablecoins were the hot potato talk. That seems to rub some of these old people wrong.
* Personally I thought many of the MoC were prepared and had done their research. Some even seemed excited to be discussing and learning about block chain, Stable coins, bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, FTX and more. They even talked NFT's. I wished they had gotten deeper into DEFI. I have a feeling that is coming.
* I thought the FTX dude killed it. He was smart, sharp, educated and didn't miss a beat.
* I hope next time they invite Vitalek!

Anyway. The hearing left me optimistic. I think the future is bright and we will own it. Keep buying those effing dips and HODL to Jupiter. We are on our way!

Video card prices and cryptocurrency mining v.2: electric boogaloo,"Six months ago, I put together a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6jl60i/video_card_prices_and_cryptocurrency_mining_whats/) on the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the prices of video cards. The hope was that supply would increase, demand would drop, and prices would return to normal. Unfortunately, prices are on the rise again.

I've therefore updated and rewritten the original post to reflect a situation that affects a large number of the builders on /r/buildapc.

---

So, you [may](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7pidfw/was_going_to_buy_a_1070_but_prices_just_keep/) have [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7pfjsn/with_the_current_situation_regarding_gpu_and_ram/) a resurgence in [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7pg3h4/buy_gpu_now_or_wait/) about the [current](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7phigw/why_did_gpu_prices_shoot_up_again/) hike in the [price](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7pbwkd/holy_crap_video_cards/) of video cards. Or you may have found the price of certain cards (especially, but not limited to, AMD's RX 570/580 and Nvidia's 1060/1070) higher than you expected.

**You know, I did. What's going on?**

In effect, cryptocurrency mining (the solving of complex mathematical problems that underlies the transactions for a given currency) continues to drive up demand for video cards, both new and used, as people invest in consumer hardware to get involved. Consequently, the availability of cards is low, and prices are high. 

With major retailer stock running low, it's hard to get an idea of the inflation at play. As a *very* general idea, here's a basic rundown of mid-tier recommended retail prices compared to current reseller prices on Amazon:

| Card | RRP (USD) | Amazon |
|--- | ---| ---|
|RX 570 4GB| [~$179](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rx-580-rx-570-gpu-polaris,34168.html)| [~$400+](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=RX+570+4GB)|

**This again? Why now?**

Cryptocurrency prices are spiralling, and people are looking to mine whatever they can. Moreover, the nature of new cryptocurrencies encourages the purchase of consumer hardware:

Bitcoin remains the largest of these currencies, but increasing concern about [transaction speed and cost](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/05/17/2188961/the-currency-of-the-future-has-a-settlement-problem/?mhq5j=e1) has recently led to a rise in alternatives. The most prominent of these is [Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/77gytn/welcome_to_rethereum_the_reddit_frontpage_of_the/).

Ethereum is designed to be [resistant to ASICs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#mining-centralization) - chips designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining - which means that potential miners must stick to consumer video cards.

**What happens next?**

Anyone who can confidently predict the long term fortunes of the cryptocurrency market probably isn't browsing /r/buildapc threads on the prices of computer hardware.

Still, eventually™ it is intended that Ethereum will switch from a [*proof of work*](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining) (i.e. mining) to a [*proof of stake*](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) (based on possession of currency) system. Long story short, this will mean no more video card demand from Ethereum miners. 

Unfortunately, there is no fixed date for when the switch is due to occur. Not to mention that this says nothing of other coins that users may try to mine.

**What can I do in the meantime?**

- Keep a close eye on /r/hardwareswap and /r/buildapcsales for deals.
- Check brick and mortar stores for leftover hardware at regular prices.
- Look for higher or lower specced cards that may be less popular with miners (e.g. 1050Ti/1080). However, users [are reporting](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7pjbus/video_card_prices_and_cryptocurrency_mining_v2/dshoxjq/) significant shifts in pricing here too.
- Watch NowInStock to keep track of the cards in question: [RX 570](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/amd/rx570/)/[RX 580](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/amd/rx580/)/[GTX 1060](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/nvidia/gtx1060/)/[GTX 1070](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/nvidia/gtx1070/)/[GTX 1070Ti](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/nvidia/gtx1070ti/)
- Wait before building, or look into prebuilts with the GPU you want (stop laughing).

Leave crypto subreddits (r/cryptocurrency) alone.,"Those subs are a place for crypto discussions, not gme. Regardless of the obvious connection between the recent crypto crash and MOASS, it is not our place to go over there and try to ""recruit"" and post off topic discussions. All apes need to find us on their own and make their own decisions. Recuritment could be seen as MARKET MANIPULATION and could be used to fuck us in the end. Giving awards to improve visibility on posts related to gme could fall into that category. Better safe than sorry, dont do it.

Just let crypto subs be about crypto. They are not isolated, they have heard about the MOASS. They are adults, let them make their own decision. My hunch is as we get closer and closer to the MOASS more people will be piling in here to blow down lines of crayola and ride the rocket to mars. ORGANICALLY

I've already seen posts over there that say they want to auto remove all posts regarding WSB ""conspiracies"". Is that how we want people to look at us? The more we stick our noses where they dont belong, the more anti gme posts will start being posted over there, plain and simple.

Think of it this way,  you're a new crypto investor and havent heard about MOASS. Your first exposure to the MOASS is on another sub talking about how we are all crazy and are going to lose all of our money. This post he read was made by a guy who just wants r/cryptocurrency to be purely about crypto. Potential new ape is now an agent of FUD and tells him what he read. You follow? 



How would we feel if some other group came in here and started posting non gme related content? We wouldn't like it. Hell, we dont even like when AMC apes post in here.

Is cryptocurrency anarchist? A minor slap fight in r/Anarchism over the leftist merits of cryptocurrency,"**Backstory:**

Brennan Lee Mulligan is from collegehumor and you may know him from the various various CEO guy sketches he did. In leftist circles, he is ""that based guy."" In ttrpg/dungeons & dragons circles he's the guy who runs Dimension 20 and their various campaigns. Lately, the staff of CollegeHumor and D20 have begun uploading their videos in a subscription service called Dropout and host various shows and gameshows alike. 

Brennan is an avid participant in these game shows. You don't have to know the rules, only that Brennan had to pretend to be an old-timey prospector getting into cryptocurrency in one of the games. 

It is not at all favorable to cryptocurrency and was uploaded in /r/Anarchism to great acclaim.

Does anyone else find that cryptocurrencies have actually helped them become more financially literate?,"Disclaimer: I'm relatively new to crypto, only getting into it around October/November of 2020. I was too young to get into it in 2009, 2013 or 2017. But ever since I learned about dollar cost averaging, my life has profoundly changed. I had worked different jobs before, sometimes part time, sometimes full time, but last October I started a new job and with the money I earned from that I was able to invest in crypto. 

I realised today that not only has this money that I invested in BTC, ETH and then a few of the more dominant altcoins led to profits from me [albeit as of yet unrealised], but the money that I have dollar cost averaged this entire time, almost six months ago, is money that, prior to getting into cryptocurrency, when I was working other jobs and stuff, I would have simply spent on alcohol or clothes or whatever. For the first time in my life, this is the most money I have ever had to my name. And don't get me wrong, it's not a lot of money by most standards, but it's life changing or me to be able to see that discipline and restraint can lead to a fund that I can fall back on. Not only is crypto an investment for me, but it's also causing me to save money I would otherwise spend, and is making me more financially secure because of it.

Resardis Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange on Side Chain,"Resardis is an order book based decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX). It promises a safe and user-friendly trading experience to cryptocurrency investors. With its structure built on the side chain tech, it provides an environment to materialize a perfect trading experience. The main goal of the project is to create a decentralized cryptocurrency trading platform for cryptocurrency investors all around the world. Only cryptocurrencies will be listed on the exchange, there will be no fiat currencies.

**Resardis DAO & Token**

Resardis is aiming to be a community driven project. Therefore, we are building a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Control of the Resardis DEX rests in the hands of the community holding the Resardis tokens ([https://etherscan.io/token/0x73627974adea82397bcf7fac5848207cce88938d](https://etherscan.io/token/0x73627974adea82397bcf7fac5848207cce88938d)). The Resardis Token exists to govern the Resardis DEX. Any changes to the DEX will be proposed and voted on by Resardis Token holders. These proposals can include things like adjusting the fee percentage, implementing scaling solutions and controlling future distribution of Resardis Token to project contributors. In future, Resardis Token will be able to be used as an optional commission payment.

**Decentralized**

Just like the cryptocurrencies themselves, Resardis lives on the blockchain. This essentially means that all the trading happens on the blockchain, secured by the state-of-art cryptography and immune to manipulation. Users are the sole owners of their funds, and the exchange does not have any control over the assets. There is nothing stored on the exchange servers, and therefore nothing to steal by the hackers or the exchange admins. You might wonder how we overcome the shortcomings of a decentralized exchange, in that case directly skip over to the side chain section.

**Side Chain**

Resardis Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is built on top of the side chain technology. As a second layer solution, side chain is optimized for scalable decentralized applications, while keeping the base-layer security of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike the other DEXs, trading is blazing-fast (1 second), the platform can handle super-high trading traffic, the trading orders live on the blockchain for free, and lastly it is possible to trade non-Ethereum and non-ERC20 based crypto-currencies such as TRON, Bitcoin and EOS. No more long trading durations and on-blockchain order fees, all while including cross-blockchain trading.

Video card prices and Cryptocurrency mining - what's going on?,"In response to [calls for a post addressing current GPU trends](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6jjt4a/mods_please_can_we_have_a_permanent_post/), this summary has been written up. It is neither exhaustive nor applicable in all regions, so be sure to research your own builds thoroughly.

---

Recently, you [may](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6iwcjy/will_the_cryptocurrency_mining_craze_end_anytime/) have [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6iwapm/massive_gpu_price_hikes/) discussion [surrounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6imtoi/discussion_cryptocurrency_and_parts_prices/) the [current](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6i74cc/this_gpu_mining_craze/) hike in the [price](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6jbale/an_explanation_of_why_some_gpus_are_so_hard_to/) of [video cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6ijju9/get_a_gtx_now_or_wait_a_couple_months/). Or you may have found the price of certain cards (e.g. AMD's RX 570/580 and Nvidia's 1060/1070) higher than you expected.

**So what's going on?**

A sharp increase in cryptocurrency mining (the solving of complex mathematical problems that underlies the transactions for a given currency) has driven up demand for video cards, both new and used, as people invest in consumer hardware to get involved. Consequently, availability of cards is low, and prices are high. 

As a very general idea, here's a basic rundown of recommended retail prices compared to current reseller prices on Amazon:

| Card | RRP (USD) | Amazon |
|--- | ---| ---|
|RX 570 4GB| [~$179](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rx-580-rx-570-gpu-polaris,34168.html)| [~$400+](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=RX+570+4GB)|
|RX 580 8GB | [~$229](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rx-580-rx-570-gpu-polaris,34168.html)| [~$500+](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=RX+580+8GB&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ARX+580+8GB)|
|GTX 1060 6GB | [~$249](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10580/nvidia-releases-geforce-gtx-1060-3gb)| [~$400+](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=GTX+1060+6GB&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AGTX+1060+6GB)|
|GTX 1070 8GB | [~$379](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/230317-nvidias-gtx-1080-and-1070-are-in-short-supply-experiencing-price-spikes)| [~$500+](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=GTX+1070+8GB&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AGTX+1070+8GB)|


**Why now?**

There are a number of different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin remains the largest, but increasing concern about [transaction speed and cost](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/05/17/2188961/the-currency-of-the-future-has-a-settlement-problem/?mhq5j=e1) has recently led to a rise in alternatives. The most prominent of these is [Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/61y5ix/welcome_to_rethereum_the_reddit_front_page_of_the/).

Ethereum is designed to be [resistant to ASICs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#mining-centralization) - chips designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining - which means that potential miners must stick to consumer video cards.

**What happens next?**

Eventually™, it is intended that Ethereum will switch from a [*proof of work*](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining) (i.e. mining) to a [*proof of stake*](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) (based on possession of currency) system. Long story short, this will mean no more video card demand from Ethereum miners.

Unfortunately, there is no fixed date for when the switch is due to occur. There are rumours of plans to introduce [cards aimed at cryptocurrency miners](http://wccftech.com/nvidia-pascal-gpu-cryptocurrency-mining-price-specs-performance-detailed/), which may help to lower prices of mainstream cards.

In the meantime:

- Regularly browse /r/hardwareswap and /r/buildapcsales for deals.
- Check brick and mortar stores for leftover hardware at regular prices.
- Look for higher or lower specced cards that are less popular with miners (e.g. 1050Ti/1080).
- Watch NowInStock to keep track of the cards in question: [RX 570](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/amd/rx570/)/[RX 580](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/amd/rx580/)/[GTX 1060](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/nvidia/gtx1060/)/[GTX 1070](https://www.nowinstock.net/computers/videocards/nvidia/gtx1070/)

Announcement: Posts about games involving cryptocurrency are no longer permitted,"Hi friends,

After monitoring community sentiment on the topic for a while and especially with the rise of NFT in the last few months, we've decided that **posts about games involving real cryptocurrency are no longer permitted here**.

Our two primary issues with cryptocurrency in games are:

1. Many appear to be scams that greatly benefit the original holders of the currency or tokens but only serve to exploit the players.
2. The use of cryptocurrency with games poses a significant and real threat to the planet by way of increased power consumption.

This rule is effective immediately however we will continue to take feedback and monitor the feelings of the community in case this change turns out to not be beneficial.

Here are some examples of types of posts that are **no longer permitted**:

* Games where gameplay takes place on a cryptocurrency blockchain via smart contracts
* Games where gameplay is modified by properties of a cryptocurrency blockchain
* Games where cosmetic changes depend on properties of a cryptocurrency blockchain
* Games that are funded via NFTs or other cryptocurrency concepts
* Games that interface with a blockchain
* Games that mine cryptocurrency
* Posts like ""Here's a cryptocurrency game that is actually one of the good ones!""
* (This list is not exhaustive)

Here are some examples of types of posts that are **still permitted**:

* Games that just use cryptocurrency as the theme
* Games that simulate cryptocurrency concepts but are not associated with a real cryptocurrency
* Posts like ""Are cryptocurrency games still bad enough to be banned?""

Feel free to discuss here and continue to provide feedback over time about this or any other rules that we do or don't have. The best way to contact us is via modmail.",asterisk_man,2022-01-14 19:32:55,2052,incremental_games
Luna Classic Now in the Top 30 Cryptocurrencies,"The fuck is this shit, now I’m starting to see why a lot of folks think crypto is just a ponzi scheme. 

I have an extensive background in shit coins and I dragged my bloodied corpse out of that game a while ago but I know a shit coin when I see one.  

When Luna was trading for 100 bucks a coin there was something like 300 million coins in circulation but now there is over 7 trillion coins in circulation. I know the degen urge to buy this is strong with some people but they’d have to burn a ton of the supply to have a hope in hell of reaching even 1 dollar. 

The only coin I’m in profit on right now is the mangled corpse of a rugged coin that I put a few bucks into for the lols right after it tanked and that’s the most crypto thing ever. I’m not even surprised tbh.  

This is just a PSA to resist the urge to buy this coin, the price will tank and reality will hit harder than a drunk step dad.

Edit:  not talking about the people putting a few bucks in for the gamble, could be worth it. Talking about people literally throwing massive chunks of their portfolio into these garbage coins.",Imalittlestitious86,2022-09-08 07:14:19,683,CryptoCurrency
